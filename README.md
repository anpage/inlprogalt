# Unofficial INL retro programmer-dumper host program

This is an effort to write host software for the INL retro programmer-dumper in Rust

It's very much not ready yet and you should go to [the official repo](https://gitlab.com/InfiniteNesLives/INL-retro-progdump)
if you just want to use the device.

Proper README coming soon.
